Introduction:
Our goal is to make a Gamification of Life app. The app is so designed to induce good habits of highly successful and productive people into the user. In real life we note that we do not get a dopamine rush for various tasks that we want to do and instead get it for things that are un-productive and un-necessary or even sometimes harmful to our health. Reverting this is our main philosophy and the gamification thinking applied.
Goal:
Our goal here is to solve two very general and common problems that everyone in the world faces on a daily basis.
1.	Quadrant II Management.
There are four quadrants of time management:
 
Ignoring Quadrant II activities is a huge and classical problem. We do not do important work unless and until they become really urgent. Furthermore, we do Quadrant III actives under the Illusion that they are important tasks. Worst, we spend so much time in Quadrant IV that we reach a saturation point and are not able to enjoy them anymore.
Every time-management and personal productivity solution ever made has had this as the backdrop. But for the first time, in the history, we will not only manage but also manipulate the Quadrants. The rules and system of the game will move tasks from Quadrant II to Quadrant I (because now they are not only important but also urgent – if you do not do them now, you lose points). And Quadrant IV can be entered only after some work in other quadrants.
This is a matter of self-control. Groundbreaking research by Dan Ariely shows us that Self-Control is greatly co-related to success, more than environment, education, financial conditions, etc…

2.	Self-Measure and sense of progress
Every system has some measure and sense of progress. In some systems it may be your bank balance, in educational system it’s CGPA, GPA, Marks and in Public IPO and stock market (e.g. Wall Street) it’s company’s economic profit.

But all these are external to oneself and judged by others and what if none of these correctly mimics what you really want to do, where your goal really lies. What if it’s not your bank balance but your contribution to the society is what matters to you? What if it’s not my CGPA but this software is what matters to me? What if it’s not all about profit for a company, but also environmental impact? 

The absence of measure and sense of progress kills these thoughts. We are here to give them space to breath.
Key Player Types: 
The whole system is a single player system and so there are no killers or socializers. Our Key Player Type here is that of Achievers who are motivated towards achieving higher self control and a better self.

Key Actions:
Keeping Track of the time it takes you to do tasks, giving points to yourself based on tasks and the time taken to complete them are the key actions that the user will be performing.
Design:
Goal:
It’s a role playing game, here we do not mean the likes of the modern roleplaying computer games, but the very earliest of the games:
“Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting…”	- Wikipedia
In this game, the players have to act, behave and gain knowledge, skills and experience to become their Ideal Self.
Narration+:
Social Psychologist have identified three aspects that will solve most of the problems in the world:
?	People should be more open and accepting towards other people who are different from themselves.
?	People should empathize with other people
?	Our Society, should grow children up with the belief that they are heroes born to do good to the society.
The narration of this game should contain these values, moreover we may even modify the Goal to include some aspect of these values.
Finally, it should be noted here that sense of purpose and heroism are integral part of games and the reason as to why the phrase “Reality is Broken” is common among gaming communities and hence, this narration, in the context of being in a game, cannot be considered to be biased.
Elements:
The game consists of many elements: Avatar, Personal Kanban, To-Do List and Habit/Regular tasks, Timer, Pomodoro and Quick Add.
Personal Kanban:
The Personal Kanban in meant for managing goals, it will consist of three sections: Past, Present and Future. A Deadline will be set for each of the Goals. The main goal of having all your present goals at one place is to raise these questions: “Am I being unrealistic with my goals?” and “Do I have very low or few goals?”
Rules: (i) Daily progress has to be made towards all the Tasks in the “Present” section. If you are not able to make Daily/Weekdays or even Weekly progress towards all your tasks, it’s an indication that you are trying to achieve too much.
(ii) If the player is unable to complete a Goal by the deadline, a few days will be added to the deadline of the particular task, and all the tasks in the “Future” section. The postponing of all the tasks will be marked in a “Life Calendar” and/or some other UI elements+. (Warning: Can be very scary).
To-Do List:
Just the basic and simple drag and drop to-do list. Tasks will be divided into four sections: Today, Tomorrow, This Week and Sometime Soon. Player will be able to assign points to tasks from the pre-defined/user defined list of “Quick Add”. Additional UI/UX in which there is a nice little graphics when a task is completed+ and/or other UI/UX signifying that clearing all the tasks in the To-do List is a major aspect of the game.
Rules: (i) Each task may or may not be assigned a specific “point”.
(ii) Zero points can be assigned to a task.
(iii) When a tasks with no assigned task is completed, it is requested as an input from the user (which can be skipped – signifying ‘zero’ points).
(iv)Separate to-do lists for different “Goals” may be created.
Habits/Regular Tasks:
Basically, stuff that you need to do again and again repeatedly. Entries may be marked as multiple times a day, daily, weekdays or weekly. A Seinfeld calendar shall be attached to each entry. Players will be required to remove a habit by themselves if they feel that they have attained it and no longer need to award themselves with points for it. More frequently done habits shall be moved to the top and less frequent/weekly habits will be moved to the bottom.
Rules: (i) Each entry must be assigned a specific “point”.
(ii) Zero points may be assigned for entries.
(iii) The player has to do “Daily” activity every day and so on.
Timer:
A pre-defined amount of points for each hour of work (eg. 10 points/hour). Only whole amount of points are added. The player can form his/her own rules in regard to what can be done and what cannot be done when the timer is running, like: (i) Can drink water (ii) Cannot talk/call anyone (iii) Pause the timer when interrupted (eg., Phone call).
Pomodoro Technique:
Basically, working for a pre-defined amount of time and then taking break for a pre-defined interval of time, eg: 25min-5min and 50min-10min. 
Rules :(i)Points for complete pomodoro, i.e. 30 min and not 25 min in a 25min-5min pomodoro.
(ii) All urges of calling someone, taking a break, switching to another task has to be controlled until the “Break” time, absolutely any kind of interruption during the “Work” time would result in complete loss of points of the particular pomodoro and would be restarted.
Quick Add:
When a player suddenly encounters a task and completes it, he must be able to award himself points for it without going through all the trouble of entering it as a task and completing it, or starting a timer. This interface will allow the user to add any amount of points. We will have some pre-defined categories in which these types of tasks are generally meant to fall, for e.g.
Facing your Fears               +10
Substantial Work                +5
Small Task                          +2
Tiny Task                            +1
We can even have this feature merged with the Habits/Regular Tasks feature.
Notes: (i) For tasks that are not repetitive, determining points can be tedious, it’s best advised to use the timer or just go by your gut feelings,  
(ii) Award points for your best efforts and not results.
Rules for Specific activities:
Different activities will call for their own rules. For example what do you do when you want to get over the habit of “small and unconscious activities” such as nail biting, one approach will be to deduct 1 point for each time you notice yourself biting nails (deducting points is not allowed in our game – explained in a later section). But, what about the time when you do not notice yourself biting the nails? The correct approach here would be to award yourself each time you notice yourself biting your nails and take the conscious action of not biting further.
Points for attending classes: How many and under what conditions?
Suppose we set 10 points / class, how do we determine which instances qualify and which do not? One can approach this in many ways, all of which have their own problems:
Approach	Trouble
10 points for attendance	You can come late to class and not concentrate, everything is fine only physical attendance matters.
10 points for being mentally present in class all the time	What if you lose concentration or get distracted due to peers? You lose all your points.
Points as per amount of time mentally present in the class.	Cognitive load and wasting of time in calculations. Counterproductive in nature, can cause irritation and frustration.
Try to be your best, concentrate again if you lose your concentration, take notes, answer questions, come up to the board, do everything you have to. At the end of the class ask yourself, “Did I earn those 10 points”? No calculations, no excuses, just go with your gut feelings. 	Very good. We solved the problem.

Each Approach has a different “attitude” and yields a different behavior. Also, “attitudes” towards one problem can leak into other problems and real life outside the game. We have to be very careful in picking the behavior and attitude that we desire.

NOTE: What we need to note here is that, “Attending Classes” itself may be against the goals/interest of someone. E.g. if someone is a nine pointer and knows that he will anyhow read the whole book for exams and gaining whatever knowledge he needs for the subject of computer networks, he may choose to not attend classes at all.
All the rules we stated so far, for e.g. “clearing the to-do list is a major objective” are obvious in the very sense of Goals, Tasks, lists and progress and not from point of view of any individual, profession, group, culture or organization. We need to remind our self that we are dealing with an insanely general problem and we cannot make many assumptions about our customers. Making any such assumptions will be a personal bias.
Point System:
No negative points:
Firstly, it is to be noted that our game will not contain any negative points, which means no (i) fines, (ii) Spending on rewards, (iii) Bonus points. This is due to a large list of reasons:
(i)	Negative points (for actions you were never supposed to take), encourages/justifies taking of these actions.
(ii)	Spending on rewards creates a virtual economy, which is complicated and takes lot of economics knowledge to manage, is managed by game developers in games and all other forms of gamification. We simply cannot have everyone with their own virtual economy, it’s too complicated and causes lot of frustration when it fails.
(iii)	Causes Over justification effect. Once the rewards are removed, all the habits vanish. Also, the player is left at a much worst motivation state than before.
(iv)	A burger is priced heavily (in the virtual economy), the conditions/rules of the game are altered and now the burger is very cheap (in the real economy, no burgers exist in the virtual economy or virtual economy completely taken off or player no longer has a gamified life) – thus the players’ consumption of burger increases dramatically, can continue for weeks – this is a highly undesirable situation.
(v)	Not getting points because of not working while watching TV or eating burgers itself is punishment enough.
(vi)	Alternatives available: In extreme cases, the player can award himself points for controlling his urges of eating burger.
(vii)	Embarks the message of “Time is Money” – the only way you can earn points is by working now and the only way you can lose points is by not working now.
Daily & Weekly:
Games never contain an ever increasing amount of points. Gold points/coins in games can be spent for items. Health points have a maximum limit, Experience points are reset after crossing every level/completing every pack. Only the level seems to be ever increasing (again, not in all games), but its’ rate is very slow. There is a simple reason for this: When you have only 82 points, working out for 5 points to make it 87 makes a lot of sense and motivates people but when you have 2772 points you are unlikely to even notice any change at all. Now there do are games which overcome time by having actions worth more points, or by simply implying that the player will have to work harder and longer for the same amount of excitement as before, but let’s be realistic: that cannot happen in Gamification of Life.
So, we have Daily and Weekly points, the points reset to 0 on a daily and weekly basis. The game follows a weekly system in which the player has to do the week’s leftover work on the weekends. There are many benefits to this:
(i)	You have to keep moving forward, no matter how well you performed in the past, it’s gone. The only thing that matters is the future.
(ii)	Starting of each day is a new beginning, bringing excitement especially Mondays!
(iii)	In weekends, many of the tasks in the “Habits/Regular Tasks” become inappropriate and it’s hard time trying to score the same number of points as in weekdays.
(iv)	We do not have any “Rewards”, the weekends can be seen as the implicit reward.
(v)	Fits the lifestyle we all already have, i.e., enjoying weekends, going out, going home, house-hold activities.
(vi)	Viewing the whole week as a single unit of time is what’s suggested in ‘The 7 Habits of Highly effective people’ and also ‘Getting Things Done’.
(vii)	When we have only a Daily system, a bad start of the day, ruins everything.
Leaderboards comparing points across multiple days and weeks.
Win State:
At the end of each day, the player has to ask himself, “Did I do it?” and if the answer is “Yes, I did It.”, he has won the day. At the death bed, just before dying, a person’s whole life flashes before his eyes, good and bad memories, and greatest joys and deepest sorrows. Here, there is no need to ask oneself, the question “Did I do it?” is embedded in the very essence of memories, the heart just knows. You won if the answer is “yes” and lost if the answer is “no”.
Voluntary Acceptance:
Finally, for any game to work, the players have to voluntary accept the rules and regulations of the game. The simple reason as to why I am not satisfied with any of the already existing solutions is that I have never been able to accept their rules. It felt like playing the game of my life, as per the rules of others.
In our game, I think people will find it very easy to accept the rules of the game, after-all they seem trivial (believe me, it was not trivial to think of them): Complete the tasks you have, make regular progress towards your goals, how you have performed earlier doesn’t matters, your own rules and your own points and finally, just ask yourself if you won.
Implementation
We will use HTML5 Technologies (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) as the front end, as it can be used as the front end in both Web & Mobile.
Did we solve the problems?
Quadrant II problem: Simply put, now you have to engage with the important tasks, simply because, if you don’t you lose, you will be faced with self-guilt, will not receive the sense of accomplishment/winning that you get on other days. Also, seeing a number go up if fun, if you don’t do you work, your daily/weekly points are stuck.
Self-Measure and sense of progress: Instead of being stuck with external numbers and people saying you as to what you should do, you now have your own number, which goes up as per your own rules, tasks and goals and most importantly, you have your inner voice saying what you worth is, what you should do, what’s right and what’s wrong.
Conclusion:
We are almost done with programming of the app and would be releasing it soon. You can have an unfinished version here: www.lifewin.co 
The Scenario
Introduction
This is a new generation personal productive app. Users make note of all their tasks, their goals and the habits they are trying to inculcate into the app. We have a behavioral design system in which users gain points for their work, keep track of how much time they have worked, and a few subtle rewards and punishments. The behavioral design system of our app is designed such that users automatically develop the habits and perceptions of highly successful and productive people. The first step here is to know these habits and perception, and then to incorporate them into our design and guidelines. 
Example Scenarios:	
1. Habit of Nail Biting
Let’s get started with this light-hearted example.
What people do: Sometimes, when they notice themselves biting nails, they stop doing so and “punish” themselves a bit in the sense to say that they “curse”and “scold” themselves.
What productive people do: Cursing and scolding oneself is not very good here. What happens when you do not notice that you were biting nails? Nothing. The right thing to do is, whenever you notice that you were biting nails, you should keep your hands down and “reward” yourself for stopping by giving yourself a mental pat at the back.
What our product does: Users have “Nail Biting” as one of their habits in our app, and we ask them to award themselves 1 point for each time they do stop biting their nails. We note the difference, we see that there must have been a “reward” in place of the “punishment”. In our app’s framework, we make a way to force the perception change.
2. Quickly starting the other task
What people do: Knowingly or unknowingly, waste sometime after completing a task and before starting the next
What productive people do: Quickly switch from one task to another. It’s okay to relax and take a break, but even these should be conscious and spend doing what the person really wants to do (e.g. talk with family on phone) in contrast to mindlessly browsing online.
What our product does: Each time you interact with the app, the app tells you how much time has elapsed from the last interaction. This gives you real time feedback on how much time have you just wasted, how much time have you taken to do each of the activities.
3. What is a reward/relaxation?
What people do: People take expensive, big and time consuming stuff to be rewards. Fancy dinner at an expensive place, diamond rings, watching movies, junk food. What’s worse is that today’s habit formation apps supports this, if not completely based on such rewards.
What productive people do: Rewards are associated with time. Each moment that you spend doing something you like, can be a reward in itself. Buying a book is not a reward, the time spent reading it is. Doing your light-hearted work is also a reward. Time spent with friends and family is reward.
What our app does: We have a ‘Rewards’ section, where the users are to enter all the relaxing and light-hearted work they are to do. There is a very thin line of difference between work and fun, mostly just cultural. Here, we break the very quadrants of time management, where a lot of what you considered ‘work’ – which indeed consumed your self-control and energy, will turn to fun. To what extent this happens and for which tasks would depend on the individual.
4. Self Measure and sense of progress
What people do: People rely on external systems for their own measure and sense of progress in life. What other people think of you. How other people behave with you. How much have you spent your life in accordance to the society’s notions? For e.g. many students after scoring a low CGPA, accept themselves to be incompetent and do not take the effort required to achieve whatever they want.
What productive people do: They too get to hear a lot of feedback from other people and systems, but at the end these do not affect them. Their sense of self measure and progress in life, lies within themselves.
What our app does: The points in our app allow people to literally measure themselves in terms of what they want to do each day and not what others want them to do. The timers can be used to clearly see how much time have you really worked. Also, we have scoreboard where users can literally compare their own performance across various different days, etc.
Elements:
Our app has various elements such as Goals, To-do List, Habits, Habit Tracker, Timer, Pomodoro Timer, Rewards and Scoreboard, which are found in numerous different apps, but will be integrated together for the first time in our app. Anyhow, it’s not about these elements, but how they are all combined together and how we translate good habits and perceptions first into behavioral design and then into a mechanism in our app. Unlike many other apps, this app is not about the output you see on the screen, but the change you see in yourself. 

Complete Features
The ultimate vision is to have a cutting edge and innovative company in the area of motivational design with flagship apps across all platforms.
The final product is targeted towards the “pro”, “tech-savvy”, “life-hackers” kind of people & people who want to become like that.
We would have a free version with the basic productivity tools and motivational design elements.
We would have premium versions priced around $5/user/month for individuals, small groups, businesses and educational institutes.
Different people are motivated by different stuff. We would have various productivity tools and game design elements that could be switched on and off – packs and suggestions will be available from us.
What’s it about:
It’s about facing your fears, overcoming all hesitations, doing whatever it takes, following your dreams, measuring life on one’s own terms.
Developing better self-control (study shows self-control more appropriately represents chances of success than salary, background, etc… in all respects). Forming good habits, increasing your chances of success, removing negative thoughts and putting in positive ones.
Having all quotes and philosophies come to life. And just, getting more productive and happy in life.
What’s all to be implemented?
1.	General stuff all productivity apps have
2.	The simple and common version of all basic motivational design elements such as points, rewards, avatar, etc…
Unique elements of the app:
3.	Daily Points (Private view): Signifies that no matter how much good or bad you were yesterday, today is all that matters.
4.	“Yes, I did It” – At the end of the day you have to ask yourself if you are satisfied, if you have won the day. A lot of parameters and not just productivity goes in to win; apart from being productive you would have to happy with yourself. I can’t even start to say about the depth and beauty of this feature.
5.	No negative/decreasing points – (users will be able to revert this feature). By this, really, the only way to loose points is by not working now and the only way to gain points is by working now – “Time is Money”.
6.	***Time since last activity – How much time you have taken to perform this activity (via toast message) – generates a sense of urgency; make layback and slow people active.
7.	Avatar (with customization) – An image to live up to – makes an avatar that represents you – the person you are, the person you want to be. The avatar’s mood, expressions and body posture changes as per your activities in the app.
8.	Goals/Tasks Count: Are you doing too less? Too much?
9.	***Rewards (We will give users the option of usual “Rewards” too) – The rewards that we give will come with a lot of twists and turns. Unlike other app where Rewards are associated with some form of currency, our rewards will be associated with your time. Each moment that you do something you truly like can be a reward in itself.
Here, we will break the Quadrants of time management. The line between what’s work and what’s fun will be blurred (actually it’s just an arbitrary line drawn by the society). There will be productivity even in procrastination – positive procrastination. Ultimately at the end, the very viewpoint from which a person sees the tasks will change. 
10.	Badges and Tags (Private View) – Your badges and Tags represents the person you are and stand for the ideologies you believe in the principles you fellow.
11.	Community – A place where user could see and get suggestions of what habits one can cultivate and what’s the best way to do them.
12.	Notes – like a little diary one can have for the “goals” /”yes! I did it”.
13.	Get Back to It – If for some day, for some reason you do not win in a day the reason for that is marked. You have to resolve it in some another day. (Unless you really think that it’s not appropriate anymore due to change in circumstances/mind set)
14.	Social – Elements where people are able to interact with each other, both on our app and also on Facebook, twitter, Q&A sites.
15.	Level – Each Habit/Goal has its own levels, the levels descriptions are fetched from community. Your level is not increased by some automatic algorithm or by getting points. It increases by change in your mind-set and hard work.
16.	Exceeding deadlines – You have a lot of Goals/Projects lined up to be done. When you do not complete these on time, these deadlines are exceeded, exceeding the deadline of all other projects lined up – therefore delaying your life.
17.	Collection – You can collect achievements, projects completed, tasks, fears overcome, habits improved, anything.
18.	Artwork – Beautiful, Stunning and deep artwork as background. You can choose the artwork that truly represents what you are going through in life right now.
19.	Graphs – Different graphical representations of the points data.
20.	Scoreboard (leaderboard) – Here your today will be compared with other days of your life (by points/timer) – the only person you need to be better than is the person you were yesterday.
21.	API
What will world do with so much productivity?
We would have a social initiate where people will be empowered to do a lot of volunteer work for NGOs and social causes to bring about change in local and global levels (again through a web app - technology). There is no end of no. of projects requiring various different skills to be implemented.
Is all this even possible? There must be some basic assumption/It just sounds impossible
Yes by the theory of fudge factor, there is a limit to extent of self control an individual can exercise in a given period of time. Anyhow, this limit can be exercised, increased. Also, habits and things perceived as “Rewards” do not come under this limit. A lot can be done within this limit itself.
Are there any negative aspects?
No, we do not have any reasons to believe so. Negative aspects can come from extrinsic rewards and virtual economies which are completely left out.
Is this not hyperactivity or workaholism?
No, we have many provisions to prevent that.
(i)	The aim of the points to get daily/weekly is set by the user himself.
(ii)	The “Yes! I did it!” feature also takes parameters such as family and friends.
(iii)	The community will mostly be dominated with Exercise, fitness and being social aspects of life.
(iv)	The avatar customization will include family, friends, sports, fitness, holiday themes and stuff in those lines.
(v)	***We have an Emergency clause. In case of physical attention or mental comforting is required by anyone near or dear, all goals, tasks and habits are dropped until the issue is resolved (also attempts to counter bystander effect).
Benefits of Goal Tracking
•	Increases motivation to achieve: Tracking your goals will also motivate you to reach even more of your goals. You will be able to look back and see just how far you have come in order to reach your goals. You’ll realize that if you can do that, anything is possible. Without the tracking, you won’t have a visual reminder of your successes.
(http://teaching.monster.com/benefits/articles/9440-effective-goal-setting-for-students)
•	Increases a sense of pride and satisfaction in performance
(http://teaching.monster.com/benefits/articles/9440-effective-goal-setting-for-students)
•	Improves self-confidence: Doesn't it feel good when you accomplish something? When you write down how much closer you are to your goal, you feel good about yourself.
(http://teaching.monster.com/benefits/articles/9440-effective-goal-setting-for-students)
•	Gives a Sense of Purpose: That is what is important in life as a life without aim is similar to an arrow without an aim to shoot. When you track goals for yourself, you give meaning to your daily routine.
(http://www.livestrong.com/article/113768-importance-setting-goals/)
•	Helps develop responsibility and self-efficacy: Tracking your goals will not only make you want to work hard but also make you feel responsible whether it may be your own success or failure.
(http://www.livestrong.com/article/113768-importance-setting-goals/)
•	Helps develop clear plans 
(http://www.livestrong.com/article/217375-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-goal-setting/)
•	Increases awareness of one’s strength and weaknesses: Setting goals will make you work hard in that particular direction and make you aware of your own strengths and weaknesses.
(http://www.livestrong.com/article/217375-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-goal setting/)
•	Makes you take charge of your life

•	Creates a positive can-do attitude
(http://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/The_Benefits_of_Goal_Setting.html)
•	Develops self-discipline and will power: If reaching a goal was so easy, we wouldn’t have to set them in the first place. Tracking your goals allows you to see where you might’ve slipped up and slowed down your progress. When you find the areas in your routine that aren’t beneficial to reaching your goals, you can discipline yourself into changing your normal habits.
(http://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/The_Benefits_of_Goal_Setting.html)
•	Increases focus by providing a direction

•	Helps make better use of time: When you track your goals, you become aware of how much closer you are to your deadline. The closer you get to your goal, the more you prioritize your time for things that are required to reaching your goal.
(http://www.relaxfocusenjoy.com/7-benefits-of-goal-setting/) 
•	Helps get faster results
(http://www.relaxfocusenjoy.com/7-benefits-of-goal-setting/)
•	Gives you a sense of control. 
(http://www.goal-setting-motivation.com/tag/benefits-of-goal-setting/)
•	Helps set specific priorities

•	Promotes a healthy sense of failure
(http://www.livestrong.com/article/217375-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-goal-setting/)
•	Limits stress

•	Helps achieve quick results: Believe it or not, you have the power to have some control over the results and your future. Want to be 10 lbs lighter 5 weeks from now? Make it a goal. Achieve it! Want to save your money by eating out less? Make that your goal!

Benefits of a To-Do List
•	Creates Order (http://www.robinskey.com/|)

•	Helps Prioritize: You have many things to do in a particular day, but some are certainly more important and time-sensitive than others. You can organize your to-do list in order of priority (http://www.robinskey.com/)

•	Creates Accountability (http://www.robinskey.com/)

•	Helps in Rescheduling and organizing your time: can be used to document the task(s) you have to complete in a particular day, week, month or year (http://www.robinskey.com/)

•	Relieves Stress: You may able to prioritize your things which may help you to tackle the most important jobs first and not waste time on trivial tasks. Thus you don't get stressed by the large number of unimportant jobs. (http://www.robinskey.com/)

•	Lets you coordinate similar tasks (http://www.ismckenzie.com/)

•	Tracks your progress: Helps you keep a realistic view of things. One of the important aspect of time management is not pushing yourself over the edge trying to complete everything you've put down. There would be days when you may be able to cross off all the items and some days will be there where you can't accomplish anything. (http://www.ismckenzie.com/)

•	Reduces Anxiety (http://www.listproducer.com/)

•	Improves Focus (http://www.listproducer.com/)

•	Boosts Your Brain Power (http://www.listproducer.com/)

•	Organizes Your Thoughts (http://www.listproducer.com/)

•	Increases Self-esteem and Happiness: It feels great to cross things off your list. This is an undeniable truth as writing down the list of things to do on a piece of paper and striking those jobs after completion makes one feel great. (http://www.listproducer.com/)
